We are using some great technologies to automate our build and testing process:

* Kanban project planning from [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/ensime/ensime-server)
* Continuous Integration from [shippable.com](https://app.shippable.com/subscriptions/5504572d5ab6cc13529ad105)
* Coverage reports from coveralls.io [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/r/ensime/ensime-server)
* Binary distribution from [sonatype.org](http://www.sonatype.org/)
* Emacs distributions from [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/ensime)

Along with unit testing, we have automated coverage checks and code
formatting as part of our build process. Pull requests will only be
accepted if the build and tests are successful, coverage has not
decreased, and the formatting style has not been changed (it is
automated, so you don't need to think about it).

If you want to try out your changes before submitting them as a PR,
follow the
[Manual Installation](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide#manual-installation)
instructions.

Pull requests will be reviewed and should not be merged by the person
who created the request (except for trivial changes and hotfixes).

We have branches for older versions of scala, which are merged regularly.
