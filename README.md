ENhanced Scala Interaction Mode for text Editors, especially [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

ENSIME brings IDE-like features to your favourite text editor, such as:

- Show the `type` of the symbol under the cursor.
- Contextual completion for `var`s, `val`s and `def`s.
- Add an import for the symbol under the cursor.
- Fast classpath search (types and members).
- Jump to source code or documentation.
- Browse packages and type hierarchies.
- Find all references to a symbol.
- Refactorings (rename, organize imports, extract method).
- REPL with stack trace highlighting.
- Errors and warnings in your code: *red squigglies*.
- Debugging

and many more.

# Quick Start

See our [Quick Start Guide](http://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) to learn how to install and start ENSIME.

ENSIME is released on a continuous "rolling release" basis every time a pull request is merged. This dramatically speeds up the development cycle and you are advised to always update your ENSIME before reporting any issues.

If you are still experiencing a problem with the latest version of ENSIME, before reporting an issue please:

* check the [tickets flagged as FAQ](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/issues?labels=FAQ).
* check the [most recently updated tickets](http://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/issues?direction=desc&sort=updated) (others are probably talking about it already with workarounds).
* do a few keyword searches using the github search (top of the page) to see if anybody has reported this already.
